# UI Project Dashboard

This project is a responsive dashboard interface built with HTML and CSS. It features a navigation menu, a header with a logo and a call-to-action button, and a main section displaying data in panels. The design has been optimized for accessibility and responsiveness across various device sizes, with a refreshed color scheme and an enhanced layout for desktop screens.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the content and layout of the dashboard.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface, including responsiveness and the updated color scheme.

## Setup

To view the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. Locate the `index.html` file in the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` directly in your web browser. No additional setup or server is required.

## Features

- **Navigation Menu**: A sidebar menu that toggles on smaller screens and remains visible on larger screens for easy access to dashboard sections.
- **Header**: Includes a logo and a call-to-action button for quick navigation or actions.
- **Data Panels**: Present key metrics (e.g., monthly, quarterly, and annual data) in a clean, organized format.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts the layout seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Design Choices

- **Color Scheme**: Features a light background (`#F0F0F0`) with dark text (`#333333`) for readability, paired with vibrant accents like `#4A90E2` (blue), `#F5A623` (orange), and `#D0021B` (red) for headers, buttons, and highlights to enhance contrast and accessibility.
- **Typography**: Utilizes the 'Nunito' font for a modern and clean appearance.
- **Layout**: Leverages flexbox for flexible alignment and responsiveness across devices.
- **Media Queries**: Includes breakpoints for an optimized experience:
  - **420px and up**: Adjusts padding and aligns text to the left for better readability.
  - **550px and up**: Centers data panels and refines navigation width.
  - **720px and up**: Switches to a two-column layout for the main content.
  - **1024px and up**: Fixes the navigation menu as a sidebar, hides the menu button, and centers the main content with a maximum width of 1200px for a polished desktop view.

## Additional Information

- **Navigation on Small Screens**: Use the menu button in the header to open or close the navigation menu on mobile or tablet devices.
- **Desktop Experience**: On screens 1024px and wider, the navigation menu is fixed as a sidebar, and the main content is centered for improved readability and aesthetics.
