### **Features**

1. **Pick a Base Color:**
   - The user selects a base color using a color picker (`<input type="color">`).
   - The selected color serves as the foundation for the generated color scheme.

2. **Choose a Color Scheme Mode:**
   - A dropdown menu provides various color scheme modes to choose from:
     - Monochrome
     - Monochrome-dark
     - Monochrome-light
     - Analogic
     - Complement
     - Analogic-complement
     - Triad
     - Quad
   - Each mode represents a different way of generating harmonious colors based on the base color.

3. **Fetch Color Scheme:**
   - Upon submitting the form, the app fetches a color scheme from **The Color API**.
   - The fetched colors are displayed dynamically in the UI.

4. **Display Colors:**
   - The fetched colors are displayed as individual boxes, each showing its respective color.
   - Each color box is accompanied by its hex code, displayed below the box.

5. **Copy to Clipboard:**
   - When a user clicks on a color box, the corresponding hex code is copied to the clipboard.
   - A confirmation alert informs the user that the color has been successfully copied.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - The app uses a mobile-first approach to ensure usability across all screen sizes.
   - On smaller screens, the form and color boxes are displayed in a single column.
   - On larger screens, the layout adapts to provide a better viewing experience with flexbox and media queries.

7. **Button Animation:**
   - The "Get Color Scheme" button has a hover effect, adding a subtle upward animation to enhance interactivity.

8. **Stylish Design:**
   - Colors are displayed with borders and shadows to make them visually distinct.
   - The layout ensures the colors occupy the viewport while maintaining a clean and modern design.

- When a color box is clicked, its hex code is copied to the clipboard using the `navigator.clipboard` API.
