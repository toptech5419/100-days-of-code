# Game of War

The **Game of War** is a simple and interactive card game that pits the player against the computer. The game uses a deck of cards to draw two cards in each round and determines the winner based on the value of the cards. The player's objective is to score more points than the computer by the end of the game.

## How It Works

### 1. New Deck Button
- **Functionality**:
  - Clicking the **New Deck** button fetches a new shuffled deck of cards from the API.
  - The remaining cards in the deck are displayed.

- **Behind the Scenes**:
  - The `deckId` is stored globally to reference the deck throughout the game.

### 2. Draw Button
- **Functionality**:
  - Clicking **Draw** pulls two cards from the current deck.
  - The cards are displayed in their respective slots: one for the computer and one for the player.
  - The game determines the winner of the round based on the card values:
    - **Ace** is the highest value.
    - Numeric cards follow their face value, and face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are ranked accordingly.
  - Scores are updated dynamically.

- **Behind the Scenes**:
  - The card data is fetched from the API.
  - The game logic compares the value of the two drawn cards and updates scores.

### 3. Remaining Cards
- The number of cards left in the deck is displayed and updated after each draw.
- When the deck is empty, the **Draw** button is disabled.

### 4. Game Status
- At the end of the game (when no cards are left), the winner is declared based on the final scores.
